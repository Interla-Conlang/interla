# Interla Conlang Generation

## Step 1 : choosing the optimal subset of characters, and the pronunciation of each character
- Assuming that we use a subset of the roman alphabet, as decided [here]()
- Assuming we want only one pronunciation for each character, as decided [here]()

**Output**: This step produces a list of characters and their pronunciation, inside the file `alphabet.csv`.

## Step 2 : generating all possible interla spelled tokens
- The tokens are generated by combining the characters from the previous step, following a set of rules.

## Step 3 : training the interla model
- The model is trained by translating a language into another one, going through the interla language.
- We choose the vocabulary dimension.
**Output**: a translation model, and a list of anonymous tokens with their coocurrences with tokens from the source and target languages, inside the file `tokens.csv`.

## Step 4 : choosing the spelling of the anonymous tokens
- We optimize the spelling of the anonymous tokens, to minimize a cost function, based on the coocurrences with spelled words from the source and target languages.

**Output**: the list of anonymous tokens with their spelling, inside the file `vocabulary.csv`.
